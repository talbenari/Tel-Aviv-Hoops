<div className='expantion-placement'><p className='expantion'><br/><br/><br/>TLV-Hoops was founded in 2023 with one objective: to bring people<br/>
together through the game of basketball without the rigidity and pressure<br/>
of gym memberships and league play. With the unpredictability of modern<br/>
life we wanted to offer games when and where works best for you.
<br/><br/>
Over the years we have cultivated an amazing community of basketball<br/>
lovers who play hard every night and respect the game. Every time you<br/>
come to an TLV-Hoops session, you are guaranteed to have a good run,<br/>
a killer workout and to spend time with a great group of players. This is what<br/>
we call “BALL FOR ALL” and that mentality is what drives us to offer the<br/>
best basketball experience available today.</p></div>
